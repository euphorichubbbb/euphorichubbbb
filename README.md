ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm a CS enthusiast on a mission to conquer the digital realm, one elegant algorithm at a time!

- ðŸ”­ In this vast world of web development, I speak the languages of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fluently. But my coding repertoire expands beyond front-end sorcery. I wield the power of Python, Java, and C++ to conquer the realms of back-end development and algorithmic wizardry.

- ðŸŒ± While I'm a prospective physical science major, I often find myself carried away by a smorgasbord of intellectual curiosities, which I explore by meandering through obscure Wikipedia pages. I love to read fantasy novels in my free time, and this combination of science and imagination inspires me for scientific writing. Besides this, I have always been enthralled by both Physics and Math and have taken part in Mathematics and Physics competitions.

- ðŸ¤” Currently, the potential of AI has always fascinated me, so I'm immersing myself in the captivating field of machine learning. From understanding the fundamentals of neural networks and deep learning to exploring frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, I'm training models and unraveling the mysteries of intelligent algorithms.

ðŸŒŸ Join me on my coding adventures as I share my projects, insights, and discoveries. Let's collaborate and create amazing software solutions together!
